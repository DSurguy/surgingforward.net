Specifically, I wanted a game everyone could play that would encourage social interaction and meeting new friends.\n\nI wanted to give every person a bingo sheet that contained silly social activities, and reward prizes when they acheived bingo or blackout on their sheet. To make it easy to hang onto their sheet, I wanted to be able to stick the sheets onto cups that people could carry around and fill with party drinks.\n\nI looked into online bingo generators, and they all wanted to charge more than I was willing to pay to generate PDFs or print the sheets. Additionally, they didn't offer flexibility on weighting of items in the generated sheets.\n\nAs I frequently do, I took matters into my own hands and decided to generate the sheets myself, and print them from my laserjet onto sticker paper. To do so, I'd need an app.\n\n## The App\nBingo-builder is a React Single Page Application (SPA) that runs entirely client-side in the user's browser, including PDF generation and download. The UI uses material-ui for design and components.\n\nUsers can create and manage \"Projects\", which are saved in localstorage in the browser.\n\n![screenshot of project list](/bingo-builder/project.png \"Project List\")\n\nAfter creating a project, users are presented with a form to fill out upon loading the application, prompting them to add at least 24 bingo tasks, categorized from easy to hard. The user can then select the distribution of easy/medium/hard tasks in each sheet, and decide how they want to handle the free space.\n\n![screenshot of bingo lines in form](/bingo-builder/lines.png \"Bingo Lines\")\n\n![screenshot of bingo settings](/bingo-builder/settings.png \"Bingo Settings\")\n\nAfter confirming, the application approximates the required font size of each bingo item by rendering the text into a ratio-appropriate box and scaling the text down until it fits. Once this process is complete, the sheets are ready to be generated.\n\nThe user can then generate their desired number of sheets, and a preview will be shown to the user. They can then create and download a PDF to be printed as they like.\n\n![screenshot of bingo generation and output](/bingo-builder/output.png \"Bingo Generation\")\n\n## Complications, Bugs and Future Development\n\n- Pixels and points don't have a clean 1-to-1 mapping, so the css rendering is an approximation of the final PDF rendering. There's some math involved, but text does occasionally overlap the box borders in the final product.\n- It's hard for users to migrate projects from one device to another. I'd like to create an import/export process to facilitate this\n- Server-side auth and storage is obviously the best user experience, but it ain't free. Still would be nice.\n- It's been a while, so it's time for a refactor away from material-UI and a big dependency upgrade.","src/content/project/bingo-builder.mdx","7b0ed7ceeb32566d","standalone",["Map",47,48],"resume",{"id":47,"data":49,"body":52,"filePath":53,"digest":54,"deferredRender":20},{"title":50,"description":51},"Derek Surguy - Resume","A little bit about me, my career and my skills","## About Me\nI began my software career as a teenager making games in RPG Maker 2003 and fiddling with PhP forum code, and creating simple HTML websites from scratch.\n\nI spent a number of years creating silly things in my free time while I studied music performance (french horn) at college for a few years. One day I realized I really should do the opposite, swapped majors to Computer Science, got a job and haven't looked back since.\n\nI absolutely love creating user experiences, and find the optimization and improvement of existing systems absolutely captivating. I thrive in an environment where the stakeholders and users are aligned and we can create streamlined interfaces that solve real problems for real people.\n\n## Primary Skills\n- HTML, JS, CSS\n  - React\n  - Tailwind CSS\n  - node / bun / npm / pnpm / yarn\n  - Browser technology\n- Full-Stack development\n  - API design\n  - General cloud design (AWS experience)\n  - SQL and No-SQL databases (sqlite, postgres, mongo, dynamoDB)\n  - Event-driven architecture\n  - Async design patterns\n- UI Design / Development\n  - Accessibility\n  - Responsive design\n  - Interactivity\n  - Component/Theme systems\n\nI experiment frequently with emerging web technology, please start a conversation if you work with something that's not on this list!\n\n## Experience\n\n### Lead Software Engineer - First Advantage (Formerly Sterling)\nFeb 2021 - Present\\\nDomain: Background Checks\\\nStack: React, Node, C#, AWS\n\n- Led team responsible for maintenance and feature development of the Candidate platform, mentoring and guiding both onshore and offshore developers\n- Owned 15+ applications deployed weekly with contributions from 5+ teams\n- Designed and implemented key features for Candidate Platform:\n  - blue-green deployment strategy and pipeline, resulting in multiple years of successful weekly deployments with production-staged test-ibility\n  - implemented third-party SSO connections (new to the platform) with identity verification partners\n  - designed and developed generic SSO solution for client partners and multiple credentials in one authentication session, including full rewrite of auth application as a new standalone UI\n- Oversaw full WCAG implementation through offshore team\n- Implemented numerous critical software architecture upgrades on legacy apps (webpack, react, testing libraries, dependency security alerts)\n\n### Senior Software Engineer - KyotoCooling\nJune 2019 - Feb 2021\\\nDomain: Data Center Cooling\\\nStack: Vue, Kotlin, AWS, Postgres\n\n- Supported and developed new features for the main software platform using Vue, Typescript and\nSCSS, focusing on improving performance and implementing high-value feature requests.\n- Redeveloped timeseries data views, improving performance of charts dramatically and offering new\ncontrols to let users create shareable views.\n- Led the design and development of a new Field Service domain within the existing software\nplatform, serving and managing tickets, assets and related data/workflows.\n- Migrated front-end build pipeline from Jenkins to Buddy, eliminating VM management and\nimproving build reporting.\n\n### Software Engineer - Dynata (Formerly Research Now - SSI)\nSep 2017 - June 2019\\\nDomain: Market Research\\\nStack: Angular 1.6, React, Scala, Postgres, AWS\n\n- Architected and developed new CMS and static website infrastructure using React, NodeJS and AWS\nservices, working toward consolidation of all member websites on one platform\n- Developed data migration tool in NodeJS to export existing website content from old management\nsystem, convert it to the new data model and import into the new management system in AWS\n- Supported Angular 1.5 apps, both internal tools and client/partner websites, improving performance\nof applications and redesigning UX to reduce data load and sluggishness\n\n### Software Engineer I & II - Austin Lane Technologies\nAug 2012 - Sep 2017\\\nDomain: Construction / Oil & Gas - Payroll, Production & Time Tracking\\\nStack: Javascript, C#, T-SQL, IIS\n\n- Redesigned and implemented new version of offline web application utilizing Javascript (ES5), HTML\nand CSS, resulting in a 90% rate of client upgrades to new versions\n- Directly supported website and application clients, implementing permanent solutions within\nsoftware, drastically reducing support volume from web applications\n- Developed biometric face tracking software for desktop and android\n\n### Web Developer Intern - Austin Lane Technologies\nJune 2011 - Aug 2012\\\nDomain: Small Business Websites\\\nStack: Joomla CMS, PhP, HTML, CSS\n\n- Designed and proposed multiple websites to local small businesses\n- Implemented, updated and maintained 10+ websites in Joomla, with custom designs\n\n## Education\nUniversity of North Texas\\\nStudied Music Performance & Computer Science\\\n2007 - 2014","src/content/standalone/resume.mdx","a93529bb0706ee4e"]
