My personal home on the internet.

Currently deployed to vercel and built with Astro. I use bun as a package manager and script runner.

The site renders hardcoded mdx files included in this repo for content pages such as blog and projects. I generate the resume with astro-pdf through a local build.

Highly likely to completely change as I work through new interests and new technology. Feel free to reach out and ask questions!
