## Our First Video Game

INSERT GAME SCREEN HERE

I dabble in game development for fun, ever since a terrible college professor 
bullied me out of being interested in gamedev in a professional capacity. I hadn't 
delivered any projects by 2024, so some friends and I decided to commit to a game jam.

We entered [Spring 2D Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/spring-2d-jam-2024), where the theme was plants. We had done 
some pre-jam brainstorming and wanted to make a fishing game where you control the fishing bobber/hook as a tiny 
submarine, so we compromised and made a regular submarine that collects sea plants.

We slammed together this game in a weekend, and got it to a playable state in time for submission. It's a little messy, 
but it works pretty well!

## How the Game Works

I recommend you try the game out on itch.io: [https://wootmeister.itch.io/gobbys-hydrophite-harvest](https://wootmeister.itch.io/gobbys-hydrophite-harvest). 
There are some quirks with the web player, but in general it works.
