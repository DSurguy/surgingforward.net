## Purpose
I created this project to support a party I hosted for friends. Specifically, I wanted a game everyone could play that would encourage social interaction and meeting new friends.

I wanted to give every person a bingo sheet that contained silly social activities, and reward prizes when they acheived bingo or blackout on their sheet. To make it easy to keep track of their sheet, I wanted to stick the sheets onto cups that people could carry around and fill with party drinks.

I looked into online bingo generators, and they all wanted to charge more than I was willing to pay to generate PDFs or print the sheets. Additionally, they didn't offer flexibility on weighting of items in the generated sheets.

As I frequently do, I took matters into my own hands and decided to generate the sheets myself, and print them from my laserjet onto sticker paper. To do so, I'd need an app.

## The App
Bingo-builder is a React Single Page Application (SPA) that runs entirely client-side in the user's browser, including PDF generation and download. The UI uses material-ui for design and components.

Users can create and manage "Projects", which are saved in localstorage in the browser.

After creating a project, users are presented with a form to fill out upon loading the application, prompting them to add at least 24 bingo tasks, categorized from easy to hard. The user can then select the distribution of easy/medium/hard tasks in each sheet, and decide how they want to handle the free space.

After confirming, the application approximates the required font size of each bingo item by rendering the text into a ratio-appropriate box and scaling the text down until it fits. Once this process is complete, the sheets are ready to be generated.

The user can then generate their desired number of sheets, and a preview will be shown to the user. They can then create and download a PDF to be printed as they like.

## Complications, Bugs and Future Development

- Pixels and points don't have a clean 1-to-1 mapping, so the css rendering is an approximation of the final PDF rendering. There's some math involved, but text does occasionally overlap the box borders in the final product.
- It's hard for users to migrate projects from one device to another. I'd like to create an import/export process to facilitate this
- Server-side auth and storage is obviously the best user experience, but it ain't free. Still would be nice.
- It's been a while, so it's time for a refactor away from material-UI and a big dependency upgrade.
