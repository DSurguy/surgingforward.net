## Purpose
This project is OLD, but it's always fun to see how a younger version of myself wrote code.

Back before [Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) had advanced mod support and custom server software, you had to download and run the server software yourself. As a true developer, I was ready to work hard to be lazy about this server setup, so I wrote an application to handle it.

## Version 1.0 (0.0.2) - From 2015

[See the code for 1.0 here](https://github.com/DSurguy/TerrariaWrapper/tree/1.0.0)

When I originally stopped working on this app (in 2015!), I left it at version 0.0.2.

I must have been doing some Object-Oriented Programming practice, because a lot of the original file structure and naming conventions are a little odd for a javascript project. The original code also uses CLI args to decide if we're doing server setup or start, which is a little silly.

You can see in this code snippet that we're importing `q` to get promises all the way back in some 0.x version of node.

```js
var Q = require('q'),
	path = require('path'),
	extend = require('extend'),
	fs = require('fs');

module.exports = new ConfigServer();
function ConfigServer(){

	this.createServerConfig = function (serverLocation){
		var defer = Q.defer();
```

1.0 only supports Windows, and was designed to be set up as a windows service eventually. I wanted to have the server register itself so it could just run in the background. I also included batch files so users could have something to double-click.

Turns out, this isn't a great design. It's almost always better to let the end user decide how to run the process in the background. Users getting this project from github would have been savvy enough to use the command line anyway.

Overall, the original project did work, and could have been easily extended to meet all my original goals. Unfortunately, the tools provided by the community largely make this project defunct, so I probably won't come back to add new features.

I wanted to include this project because it is one of the few projects that actually functions and could be considered "complete". I decide to update the project to a more modern tool stack, make sure it had no security issues and ensure that it still functions.

## Version 2.0 - From 2025

The latest version 2.X can be viewed directly at the main branch: https://github.com/DSurguy/TerrariaWrapper

Compare 2.0.0 to 1.0.0 here: https://github.com/DSurguy/TerrariaWrapper/compare/1.0.0..2.0.0

This update had a few goals:

- Understand and test the project so I can write this blog post
- Eliminate dependency security alerts
- replace deprecated libraries
- Move away from the OOP structure
- Support Linux

### Tool and Dependency Updates
![screenshot of package.json update diff](/terraria-wrapper/pkg-diff.png "package.json update diff")

The first order of business was to massively increase the supported version of node. The original project was almost certainly using a 0.x version, and was ten years out of date. Modern versions of node js support promises natively, so there was no longer a reason to include the `q` package.

`extend` was a crutch for lacking the spread operator, so it also was deprecated.

Last, the `unzip` package had not been updated in some time. The `decompress` package in comparison was still receiving 2m weekly downloads. It also has no vulnerabilities on the current release version.

### Code Refactor
Moving away from q-based promises into async/await required quite a bit of untangling, but the code ended up MUCH flatter afterward, and it is easier to wrap individual actions in try/cache for messaging.

The code was transitioned away from a legacy nodejs module export pattern and Promise then/catch pattern. Functions are now async where appropriate, and are more imperative/functional. Instead of a GetServer and ConfigServer, there are just modules that export functions that do things.

Any TitleCase files/variables/etc were renamed back to camelCase, which makes more sense for a js project.

### Linux Support
Since I've largely moved away from Windows, it was really going to be annoying to test and dev this project if it didn't support linux. The terraria server packages now include Linux and Mac runtimes, so I decided to add support for linux while I updated everything.

The only difference between the two platforms is the location of the server files within the zip, and the name of the executable file. Now that node has been updated, we can really trust the `os` module, making it easy to detect Windows or Linux. I added some platform-specific logic to handle making the executable executable, but otherwise we just have to run the same logic for both platforms.

### It Still Works!
The Readme has been updated with correct instructions, and I've tested both Arch Linux and Windows 10 as supported platforms, so feel free to try it out and play some terraria!
