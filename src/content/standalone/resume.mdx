## About Me
I began my software career as a teenager making games in RPG Maker 2003 and fiddling with PhP forum code, and creating simple HTML websites from scratch.

Since then I've worked in web development for multiple industries and owned numerous applications. I've had the opportunity to leave every platform in a better state than when I found it.

I absolutely love creating user experiences, and find the optimization and improvement of existing systems absolutely captivating. I thrive in an environment where the stakeholders and users are aligned and we can create streamlined interfaces that solve real problems for real people.
