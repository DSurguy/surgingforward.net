## Welcome!
My new website is now live here on [https://surgingforward.net](https://surgingforward.net)! Please poke around and explore.

My github is pretty open, and I've included some specific projects to highlight and talk about on the [projects page](/projects). Take a look at [my resume](/resume) and projects to see what I've been up to professionally.

If you want to get in touch, there are some helpful links on the [contact page](/contact)

I've got a bunch of ideas for blog posts, so hopefully this section fills out as well, keep track of the [blog page](/blog) to read these when they come out.

This site is built in [Astro](https://astro.build/) from scratch, which is been a pretty lovely experience. I tried to build it on Next.js (just for some practice), but it's really just not well-suited to a mostly static website. I also tried self-hosting it, and BOY does it need some beefy resources to build.

I don't think this site is perfect, but I have clear direction on the things I want to update. I'd rather have an imperfect site on the web instead of none at all.

Thanks for visiting, and please feel free to send me feedback or opinions!
