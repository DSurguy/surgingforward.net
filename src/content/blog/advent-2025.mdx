https://adventofcode.com is an excellent website that pops up in December every year, providing challenging (but fun!) programming exercises. They exercise a part of the software development discipline that we frequently don't get to practice on the job with front-end dev work.

This year (2025), the author has had to cut back on scope, due to people being annoying. That's a bummer, but with only 12 challenges to complete, I'm feeling more motivated than years past, and I plan to finish the whole thing.

Feel free to follow along on my github repo as I post solutions, and I'll periodically update this post with links to the new solutions.

This year, I'm tackling the problems with Typescript and Bun, and focusing on producing clear output that other developers can learn from.

You can find the root of the repo here: https://github.com/DSurguy/advent-2025 with some instructions for setup. Otherwise, here are links directly to the solutions. They each have readme files with full instructions for setup, running and output.

I hope you choose to tackle these as well, I'd love to hear how you get on. Good luck!
